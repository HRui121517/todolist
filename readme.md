Javascript todo list app. Todo list is such a common 'intro to framework' type of project therefore I gotta make one too.

That being said, this is more of a repo for me to learn the difference in different frameworks.

Originally coded in vanilla js, I will attempt to create the same project in frameworks I'm trying to learn.

**React**

One of the main reason for using a js framework is the difficulty of keeping the UI in sync with the state.

In React, the state of the todos are set initially and deleting items is non-destructive using 'filter' method (it returns a new array).

On an unrelated note, the readme for create-react-app is so long.
